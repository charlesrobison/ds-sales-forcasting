- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: visualization

## Workflow
1. Raw sales data â†’ staged in dbt
2. Aggregated into daily sales fact table
3. Forecast next 30 days using Prophet

## Next Steps
- Add anomaly detection for unusual sales spikes
- Deploy model in the cloud (Vertex AI / similar)
- Build dashboard in Tableau/Hex
